clcache.py - a compiler cache for Microsoft Visual Studio
---------------------------------------------------------

clcache.py is a little Python script which attempts to avoid unnecessary
recompilation by reusing previously cached object files if possible. It
is meant to be called instead of the original 'cl.exe' executable. The
script analyses the command line to decide whether *one* source files is
to be compiled. If so, a cache will be queried for a previously stored
object file.

If the script is called in an unsupported way (multiple source files in
one invocation, compiler called for linking), the script will simply
relay the invocation to the real 'cl.exe' program.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code comes with a small http://www.py2exe.org/[py2exe] script which
makes it easy to compile the Python code into an executable. You can generate
an executable on your system by running

    python setup.py py2exe

This will put the resulting binary and all the dependencies into a 'dist\\'
subdirectory.  You could then tell your build system to use 'clcache.exe' as
the compiler binary, or you could rename 'clcache.exe' to 'cl.exe' and put it
into a directory which comes first in the +PATH+. In my case, I went for the
latter solution; I put the 'cl.exe' binary into '%HOME%\bin' and prepended that
directory to the +PATH+.  The 'cl.exe' wrapper binary will notice that it was
renamed and forward all the arguments to the real compiler executable.

This way, simply running 'cl' will invoke the script instead of the real
compiler.

Options
~~~~~~~

--help::
    Print usage information
-s::
    Print some statistics about the cache (cache hits, cache misses, cache
    size etc.)
-z::
    Reset the cache statistics, i.e. number of cache hits, cache misses etc..
    Doesn't actually clear the cache, so the number of cached objects and the
    cache size will remain unchanged.
-M <size>::
    Sets the maximum size of the cache in bytes. The default is 1048576000
    Bytes.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CLCACHE_DIR::
    If set, points to the directory within which all the cached object files
    should be stored. This defaults to `%HOME%\clcache`
CLCACHE_CL::
    Can be set to the actual 'cl.exe' executable to use. If this variable is
    not set, the 'clcache.py' script will scan the directories listed in the
    +PATH+ environment variable for 'cl.exe'.
CLCACHE_CL_BASE::
    Can be set to a filename like "cl_real.exe". clcache will look for a file
    with this name in the same directory as "clcache.exe" (useful if you 
    rename the 'real' cl.exe and copy clcache.exe in place)
CLCACHE_LOG::
    If this variable is set, a bit of diagnostic information is printed which
    can help with debugging cache problems.
CLCACHE_DISABLE::
    Setting this variable will disable 'clcache.py' completely. The script will
    relay all calls to the real compiler.
CLCACHE_HARDLINK::
    If this variable is set, cached object files won't be copied to their
    final location. Instead, hard links pointing to the cached object files
    will be created. This is more efficient (faster, and uses less disk space)
    but doesn't work if the cache directory is on a different drive than the
    build directory.
CLCACHE_DIRECT::
    If set, switches on clcache's "direct" mode, similar to ccache's direct
    mode. Cache hits should be faster as the compiler will not be invoked.


How clcache works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

clcache.py was designed to intercept calls to the actual cl.exe compiler
binary. Once an invocationw as intercepted, the command line is analyzed for
whether its a command line which just compiles a single source file into an
object file. This means that all of the following requirements on the command
line must be true:

* The +/link+ switch must not be present
* The +/c+ switch must be present
* The +/Zi+ switch must not be present (+/Z7+ is okay though)
* There must be exactly one source file present on the command line.

If all the above requirements are met, clcache forwards the call to the
preprocessor by replacing +/c+ with +/EP+ in the command line and then
invoking it. This will cause the complete preprocessed source code to be
printed. clcache then generates a hash sum out of

* The complete preprocessed source code
* The `normalized' command line
* The file size of the compiler binary
* The modification time of the compiler binary

The `normalized' command line is the given command line minus all switches
which either don't influence the generated object file (such as +/Fo+) or
which have already been covered otherwise. For instance, all switches which
merely influence the preprocessor can be skipped since their effect is already
implicitely contained in the preprocessed source code.

Once the hash sum was computed, it is used as a key (actually, a directory
name) in the cache (which is a directory itself). If the cache entry exists
already, it is supposed to contain a file with the stdout output of the
compiler as well as the previously generated object file. clcache will
copy the previously generated object file to the designated output path and
then print the contents of the stdout text file. That way, the script
behaves as if the actual compiler was invoked.

If the hash sum was not yet used in the cache, clcache will forward the
invocation to the actual compiler. Once the real compiler successfully
finished its work, the generated object file (as well as the output printed
by the compiler) is copied to the cache.

Direct Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct mode operates in the same way as ccache's 'direct mode'. clcache
inspects command line arguments and hashes the input source file, this
hash is used as a key to lookup metadata from a previous build.

This metadata is a list of files and md5 hashes of each. If the file
hashes match the previous build the object file is returned along with
compiler stderr and stdout.

If the metadata does not exist or files have changed the real compiler is 
executed and the stderr, stdout and object file saved. If the compilation
is successful clcache now runs the same step but in "cl /E" mode to obtain
a list if all #included files. This is used to build the metadata mentioned
above.

The main advantage of this mode is that the compiler is not invoked at all 
for cache hits. misses incur the overhead of running the pre-processor again
and md5ing all the inputs.
